                        <p>If you have a complicated geoprocessing workflow or you want to be able to easily 
                            repeat an analysis using different data or parameters, a model is the way to go. 
                            We design custom tools...to be continued.

                        <p>Visvual analysis is performed in many ways and one way that G15 specializes in is the overlaying
                             of data layers on top of one another in order to more effectiveyl see the impacts of multiple data 
                             sets on an area or to enhance a map for visual impact.  With an eye for detail and analysis our Team 
                             is able to discern fine details and trends that impact an area and are relevant to the clients needs.</p>

                        <h3>Feature Selection and Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Data analysis is the one of the core parts of the GIS industry as it pulls out all the meaning to the terabytes of data floating around
                            us.  Here at G15 services we have systems and setups that can automatically analize large amounts of data in a live
                            scenario or we can also take a more manual approach to the analysis.  Complicated algorithms and a high understanding 
                            of the industry will allow us to bring levels of comprehension and insight to the data that were previously not seen or
                            accounted for.

                        <h3>Topology Processing</h3>
                        <p>We will review, clean, and construct the topological data.  Our past years of experience in the GIS industry
                            have exposed us to many different data models and we have developed the skillsets to deal with each once 
                            and make sure the topological data is accurate and precise.

                        <h3>Data Conversion</h3>
                        <p>With the large amount of geo-graphical data at our expose, it is always wise to go for data conversion 
                            rather than recreating it.Incompatible information formats are a big issue while transferring data among different applications. 
                            With G15 conversion services, we ensure that these issues are rectified completely and the end user 
                            gets their data into almost any software solutions.

                        <h3>Data Integration</h3>
                        <p>Our data integration services provides the interconnetivity of various systems and their data.
                            Combined with our other services, this will ensure data gets to where it needs to and is able to traverse
                            all systems efficiently.  Automated and manual data integration services are both offered and will depend on
                            the requirements of the business process and what would be the best solution.  Integration of geoprocessing tools
                            and processes allows for automated scripts to do analysis and changes in a secure and reliable environment.
